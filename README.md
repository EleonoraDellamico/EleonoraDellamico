✨ I'm Eleonora becoming a ***Frontender*** after an amazing experience working in a **start-up** and digging deeper into **Web sites and UX**. 
In addition I'm a sociologist  holding a master in human resources. I think study human behavior it's extremely important in this job for this reason I did different courses about **User Research** **CX Research and UX Testing** in Platzi, I follow the company **TeaCup Lab's** and besides improving and learning more about code I'm reading this book: "Handbook of Usability Testing: How to Plan, Design, and Conduct Effective Tests".

📑 My motto is 
> “'If we're growing, we're always going to be out of our comfort zone.'
> 🧗‍♀️(John Maxwell). ✨
